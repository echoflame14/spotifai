# Enhanced Spotify Recommendations System

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the Spotify AI recommendation system, dramatically improving the quality and personalization of music recommendations through expanded data collection, advanced audio analysis, and sophisticated AI prompting.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Re-Authentication Required

**If you were using the app before this update, you need to log out and log back in to access the new audio features.**

### Why Re-Authentication is Needed
The enhanced recommendation system now requests additional Spotify permissions:
- **`user-read-audio-features`** - Enables analysis of track characteristics like energy, danceability, and mood

### How to Re-Authenticate
1. Click "Log Out" in the app
2. Log back in through Spotify 
3. Grant the new permissions when prompted
4. Enjoy enhanced recommendations with audio analysis!

### What Happens if You Don't Re-Authenticate
- The system will continue working with all other enhancements
- Audio features will be unavailable (you'll see a warning in logs)
- Recommendations will use genre, artist, and listening pattern analysis instead
- You can re-authenticate at any time to enable audio features
