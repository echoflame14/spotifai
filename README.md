## Troubleshooting

### Spotify Playlist Creation Error (403 - Insufficient Client Scope)

If you encounter a "403 - Insufficient client scope" error when creating playlists, this is a known intermittent issue with Spotify's API. Here's how to resolve it:

#### Immediate Solutions:
1. **Re-authenticate**: Log out and log back in to refresh your Spotify permissions
2. **Wait and retry**: The issue often resolves itself within a few hours
3. **Check Spotify status**: This may be a temporary API issue on Spotify's side

#### For Developers:
- Ensure your app includes these scopes: `playlist-modify-public`, `playlist-modify-private`, `playlist-read-private`
- The error often occurs due to intermittent issues with Spotify's scope validation
- Monitor the logs for detailed error information

#### Why This Happens:
This is a known issue in Spotify's API that affects many developers. The problem is intermittent and typically resolves without any code changes required.

## Enhanced Recommendation Tracking System

### Intelligent Duplicate Prevention
Spotifai now features a sophisticated tracking system that prevents the AI from suggesting the same tracks repeatedly:

#### Key Features:
- **Time-based tracking**: Monitors recommendations over configurable time periods (24-72 hours)
- **Artist frequency analysis**: Prevents over-recommending the same artists
- **Cross-method tracking**: Considers recommendations from individual suggestions, playlists, and lightning mode
- **Smart validation**: Checks for exact duplicates and artist overuse before making suggestions
- **Enhanced prompts**: LLM receives detailed context about recent recommendations and diversity requirements

#### Database Enhancements:
- `session_adjustment`: Stores user's session-specific preferences
- `recommendation_method`: Tracks the source (standard, lightning, playlist)  
- `was_played`: Records if user actually played the recommendation
- `last_played_at` & `play_count`: Tracks engagement metrics
- Time-based queries with automatic cleanup

#### Benefits:
- **Better Discovery**: More diverse recommendations that avoid repetition
- **Improved User Experience**: Fresher suggestions that respect listening patterns
- **Smart Context**: AI understands what you've heard recently and adjusts accordingly
- **Artist Diversity**: Prevents over-recommending favorite artists while maintaining taste alignment
